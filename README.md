# Twitter Timeline in React Native!
## Overview
Due to the deprecation of TwitterKit, there is no way to implement Tweets/Tweet Timelines into mobile apps without using a WebView. I'm working on solving this problem! This repository provides an easy implementation of a Twitter Timeline. Because of security concerns I do not include my Twitter Api calls in this repository, I have simply stored a sample response object in the file data.json which is the same thing that the get tweet timeline API would return. Currently, the code supports media, including videos, but I am working on displaying quoted tweets and expanded urls next. UI adjustments still need to be made especially for video display before it can be packaged onto the npm library.
